This is a set of scripts I'm building to automate a mass portrait shoot with 
QR codes.  The basic idea is that I'll first generate a bunch of small cards, 
each with a unique number and a QR code corresponding to that number.  I'll then
hand the cards to each successive client, taking a single photograph clearly 
showing the QR code before beginning their session.  Afterwards, after doing a 
batch RAW conversion on the images I'll split them up into directories using 
the QR code images, and then dump them onto a web server with a small PHP 
script to display them to clients.  Each step of this process will be handled by
a separate script, and I'll document them here as I go along.

gencards.py - Generates a PDF file containing the desired number of number/QR
cards.  Usage is simply:

  gencards.py <number of cards> <output file>

The layout of the cards is fully customizable, but configuration is done through
constants in the script itself.  You'll find all the relevant settings towards 
the top of gencards.py under the section "User Parameters"
